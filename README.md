# kingofsat2satip

Usage:
Adapt getchannels.sh to your needs - change satip server name, adapt URLs to satellite positions you receive (check URLs at kingofsat.net), modify pyton script calls regarding your diseqc setup.
Then just execute the sh script, it downloads php files from kingofsat.net and creates m3u files with satip rtsp URLs. The m3u playlists can be used i.e. with VLC.
```
sh ./getchannels.sh
```
